## Introduction

Welcome to Splatuner! This is one of my first big projects as a developer and I would like you to know: I don't type essays. Lets get to the point. Expect a lot less grammar and punctuation from here on out.

## Example:
<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/xs5u9p?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

## THIS IS IN NO WAY DONE AND THERE DO SEEM TO BE [BETTER ALTERNATIVES](https://aminoapps.com/c/splatoon/page/blog/how-to-make-an-inkling-voice-on-audacity/eYeS_3ubz8wx76abjNplMXwR04pLl8p) AT THE MOMENT. DO NOT EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM THIS!!!

## About
I was looking into audacity macros a little while back, and thought: "This is literally an audio editor that can do things automatically. Why dont I make a Splatoon voice changer?? And so it begun. For a few weeks I was researching audio and what makes your voice iconic when it is underwater. 
> Fun Fact: your voice's deeper tones are lost when you speak underwater.)

And then I thought; why not make it available to the public?? I asked the community and everyone I asked told me to code it myself because it would be cooler and stuff. I hate you. All of you. But I love yall so much, I cant turn a request away. and so I haven't. and so

## here we are. 
...
##  ok now how do i use it
Ok! Now to use it! This is the part where I lose my patience and grammar at the same time.

1. First were going to input our I/O location. This is where the input AND output are located. I did that for simplicity. I'm well aware its cheap lol![example I/O location](https://github.com/okmrsavageYT/Splatuner/blob/releases/assets/Screenshot%202021-06-04%20121802.png?raw=true)

> Make sure there is a \ at the end!
