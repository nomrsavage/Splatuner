## Introduction

Welcome to Splatuner! This is one of my first big projects as a developer and I would like you to know: I don't type essays. Lets get to the point. Expect a lot less grammar and punctuation from here on out.

## Example:
<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/xs5u9p?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

## THIS IS IN NO WAY DONE AND THERE DO SEEM TO BE [BETTER ALTERNATIVES](https://aminoapps.com/c/splatoon/page/blog/how-to-make-an-inkling-voice-on-audacity/eYeS_3ubz8wx76abjNplMXwR04pLl8p) AT THE MOMENT. DO NOT EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM THIS!!!

## About
I was looking into audacity macros a little while back, and thought: "This is literally an audio editor that can do things automatically. Why dont I make a Splatoon voice changer??" And so it begun. For a few weeks I was researching audio and what makes your voice iconic when it is underwater. 
> Fun Fact: your voice's deeper tones are lost when you speak underwater.

And then I thought; why not make it available to the public?? I asked the community and everyone I asked told me to code it myself because it would be cooler and stuff. I hate you. All of you. But I love yall so much, I cant turn a request away. and so I haven't. and so

## here we are. 
...
##  ok now how do i use it
Ok! Now to use it! This is the part where I lose my patience and grammar at the same time.

> This guide is meant for v0.0.5.5, and may not work for future versions. It's quite simple really, so you shouldn't have a hard time figuring it out before you've see it.

## 1. 

**First were going to input our I/O location. This is where the input AND output are located.**
I did that for simplicity. I'm well aware its cheap lol![example I/O location](https://github.com/okmrsavageYT/Splatuner/blob/releases/assets/Screenshot%202021-06-04%20121802.png?raw=true)

> Make sure there is a \ at the end! 

## 2.
Now input the name and extension. (see [SoX Manual](http://sox.sourceforge.net/soxformat.html#:~:text=SoX%20can%20read%20and%20write,overriding%20the%20file%20type%2C%20e.g.) for more information on supported filetypes)
![Example name](https://github.com/okmrsavageYT/Splatuner/blob/releases/assets/Screenshot%202021-06-04%20122051.png?raw=true)

> You can also type rec to record. More info on that later. 

## 3.
**Now we need to input the name of the exported file.** Make sure it ends with .wav because Splatuner compatibility garbage. I'll fix it later.

## 4.
**And now we wait.** This should only take a few seconds, and larger files will obviously take longer.
![AHHHHHHHHHH CLIPPING HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE](https://github.com/okmrsavageYT/Splatuner/blob/releases/assets/Screenshot%202021-06-04%20133039.png?raw=true)

> You can convert the .wav to another file format (such as back to .ogg) in a wonderful program like [audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) or a [cheap online converter ~~that will destroy the quality~~](https://cloudconvert.com/).


> The audio is automatically made available for SFM! yw lol

## oh yeah the rec function
so uh...... just type rec and input how long you want to record
then wait 3 seconds for it to start recording for however long you set it
and then refer to the output part of this tutorial

## And there you have it!
You now know how to make drowning kid noises. Have fun!
