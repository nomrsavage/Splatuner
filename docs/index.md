Hi! This is the download site for an accurate splatoon voice changer that uses ACTUAL RESEARCH (woah) and EXPERIMENTATION (sampling). (Fun Fact: your voice's deeper tones are lost when you speak underwater.)

# Example:
<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/xs5u9p?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>


THIS IS IN NO WAY DONE AND THERE DO SEEM TO BE [BETTER ALTERNATIVES](https://aminoapps.com/c/splatoon/page/blog/how-to-make-an-inkling-voice-on-audacity/eYeS_3ubz8wx76abjNplMXwR04pLl8p) AT THE MOMENT. DO NOT EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM THIS!!!
