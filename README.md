# about

instructions and documentation can be found [here](https://okmrsavageyt.github.io/Splatuner/).

if your annoyingly impatient a download can be found [here](https://okmrsavageyt.github.io/Splatuner/download).

## next up:
> (not in repo yet, will be included with update)

[x] clipping (fixed, some clipping still does occur. further investigation is required. marked done for now)

[ ] The pitch. omg my ears.

[-] I have just realized that the icon I am using is copyrighted. I will replace it in the next update. (this is big because a lot of places reference the files so replacing might be hard)

[-] Functionality switches to control quality and automation. Kind of like sfm startup commands.
