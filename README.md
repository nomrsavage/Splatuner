probably the first accurate Splatoon voice filter!

THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR FINISHED AND ONLY HALF OF THE EFFECTS ARE ACTUALLY IN THIS VERSION SO EXPECT IT TO SOUND BAD
(0.0.3 has all effects, but are not tuned. More may be added.)

# Coming Soon! (But you can still test it!)

Coming Soon! I just need to figure out how to get it off my computer... and the whole *user friendly* thing too, but yk lol

You can dm me on discord at okmrsavage#0861 if you want to try it till then!

# about

This is an accurate voice changer that uses ACTUAL RESEARCH (woah) and EXPERIMENTATION (sampling).
(Fun Fact: your voice's deeper tones are lost when you speak underwater.)


Current version only includes inklings, (octolings coming soon) and the inkling girl is less developed. (due to lack of voice samples, im a boi so if any of you gorls wanna help u can dm me a clip of you singing or reading the bee movie script (also please dont curse or anything of the sort, i would really appreciate it))

woah thats the most parentheses ive ever used


# Special thanks:
